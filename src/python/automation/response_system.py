                                     severities to lists of predefined response actions.

        Asynchronously handles a detected threat by determining and executing
        appropriate automated response actions based on pre-configured rules.

        The method first identifies the relevant response actions from its
        configuration based on the `threat_finding`'s type and severity.
        It then executes these actions (e.g., blocking an IP, isolating a host).
        Finally, it records the details of the actions taken and their outcome
        as a `ThreatResponse` object, which is also added to the action history.

        Args:
            threat_finding (Dict): A dictionary containing details of the detected
                                   threat. Expected keys might include:
                                   - 'id' (str): A unique identifier for the threat.
                                   - 'type' (str): The type of threat (e.g., "malware_detection",
                                     "suspicious_login"). This is used to look up
                                     response actions in the configuration.
                                   - 'severity' (str): The severity of the threat (e.g.,

                       during threat handling, though individual action failures
